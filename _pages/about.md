### About Me


I am an assistant professor in the Computer Engineering and Computer Science Department at [California State University, Long Beach.](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/computer-engineering-computer-science) My main [research](/research) area is in the theory and applications of [scientific machine learning](/research/). I am also interested in using data science to inform public health and policy decisions.

Previously, I worked as a post-doc in the Computer Science Department at [Virginia Tech](https://cs.vt.edu), where I also received my PhD. My thesis focused on efficient numerical methods for initial value problems. Most of that work has been [published](/publications) in SIAM, Elsevier, and Springer journals and was [presented](/talks) to the scientific computing community.

### Prospective Students

  I am looking for inspired students to work with. You can find out more about my research from [my group's profile](https://sarshar.dev/lab/) and highlights of our recent [research projects](https://sarshar.dev/research/). If applied machine learning research is of interest to you, the best way to contact me is to complete a brief [interest form]( https://forms.gle/YQcw92ZJorb4NmVV9).
