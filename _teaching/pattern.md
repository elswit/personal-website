## Learning Resources
**Zero Cost Course Materials**: This course does not have a required textbook. However, some readings will be assigned from open educational resources based on the topic. Here are a number of excellent machine learning books you can access for free: 

- [The Little Book of Deep Learning](https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html) by François Fleuret. Available through CC BY-NC-SA license. This book is a great primer for deep learning and it covers many of the pre-requisites for our class. 
-  [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python](https://www.statlearning.com/), by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, and R. Tibshirani. Made available by the authors. Standing in the middle of theory and practice, this book provides a more statistical view of machine learning and is also a great reference for python implementations of traditional ML. 
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf), by C.M. Bishop. Available from Microsoft Research. This is _the book_ if you want to learn machine leaning theory at a deeper level of understanding.

## Evaluation Components 

Every practical project in this course entails some form of coding in Python. The students will compile their findings into a brief report, which they will submit along with a link to their reproducible code on Github. The projects are not intended to be at the level of the industry, but rather to improve the students' skills in using ML for a particular application. Maintaining sound software engineering practices and technical documentation is crucial for a successful career and as such, it is part of the evaluation. 

| Evaluation Components | Percent |
|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| 8 mini-projects       | 8 ✕ 10%     |
| Code reproducibility  | 5%      |
|  Report Quality       | 5%      |
| Attendance            | 10%     |
| **Sum**               | **100%**|

Extra credit will be available throughout the semester to make up for an assignment that did not earn you high marks. These will typically involve solving problems in novel ways or researching an interesting topic and reporting back to the class on it.

## Grading Policy

| Letter Grade | Score |
|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| A                     | 90% or above |
| B                     | 80-89%     |
|  C                    | 70-79%      |
| D                     | 60-69%     |
| F                   | Below 60%   |
 
## Special Accommodations

We are committed to providing equal opportunities for all students in our courses. If you require any special accommodations due to a documented disability, medical condition, or other circumstance that may affect your ability to fully participate in the course, please notify me as early as possible. Also, please contact the [Bob Murphy access center (BMAC)](https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/bob-murphy-access-center) for more information. BMAC personnel will work with students to identify a reasonable accommodation in partnership with appropriate academic offices and medical providers. Only approved BMAC petitions will be accommodated.

Any student who is facing academic or personal challenges due to difficulty in affording groceries/food and/or lacking a safe and stable living environment is urged to contact the [CSULB Student Emergency Intervention & Wellness Program](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/studentdean/emergency_grant/). Additional resources are available via [Basic Needs Program](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/basic_needs_program/index.html).For mental health assistance please check out [CSULB Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/caps/).

## Academic Integrity

Before attending the class, please make sure that you have invested some time to read about CSULB academic integrity policy [here](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-business/office-of-the-dean/academic-integrity). Of particular importance, are the definitions of *Plagiarism* and *Cheating*, and the steps the university will take to adjudicate academic integrity cases.

Work that you submit is assumed to be original unless your source material is documented appropriately, using proper citation. **This includes using AI assistance in writing, coding and solving problems**. At a minimum, any student caught violating Academic Integrity Policy will receive no credit for the work concerned and one grade lower letter grade.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that this course outline may change without prior notice. There may be instances where adjustments are needed for the course content, schedule, or grading policy. As a result, it is important that students check the official course syllabus on canvas regularly for the latest updates.
