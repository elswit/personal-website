## Course Outline 

This course is an introduction to automata and the theoretical foundations of computing. Students will explore the formal models of computation, study both the power and limitations of various computational paradigms, and understand the fundamental principles that underpin the design and analysis of algorithms.

## Evaluation Components 


| Evaluation Components | Percent |
|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| Assignments (6 sets)  | 6 ✕ 10% |
| Mid Term 1            | 15%     |
| Mid Term 2            | 15%     |
| Attendance            | 10%     |
| **Sum**               | **100%**|

Extra credit will be available throughout the semester to make up for an exam or assignment that did not earn you high marks. These will typically involve solving problems in novel ways or researching an interesting topic and reporting back to the class on it.

## Grading Policy

| Letter Grade | Score |
|:---------------------:|:-------:|
| A                     | 90% or above |
| B                     | 80-89%     |
|  C                    | 70-79%      |
| D                     | 60-69%     |
| F                   | Below 60%   |
 
## Special Accommodations

We are committed to providing equal opportunities for all students in our courses. If you require any special accommodations due to a documented disability, medical condition, or other circumstance that may affect your ability to fully participate in the course, please notify me as early as possible. Also, please contact the [Bob Murphy access center (BMAC)](https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/bob-murphy-access-center) for more information. BMAC personnel will work with students to identify a reasonable accommodation in partnership with appropriate academic offices and medical providers. Only approved BMAC petitions will be accommodated.

Any student who is facing academic or personal challenges due to difficulty in affording groceries/food and/or lacking a safe and stable living environment is urged to contact the [CSULB Student Emergency Intervention & Wellness Program](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/studentdean/emergency_grant/). Additional resources are available via [Basic Needs Program](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/basic_needs_program/index.html).For mental health assistance please check out [CSULB Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/caps/).

## Academic Integrity

Before attending the class, please make sure that you have invested some time to read about CSULB academic integrity policy [here](https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-business/office-of-the-dean/academic-integrity). Of particular importance, are the definitions of *Plagiarism* and *Cheating*, and the steps the university will take to adjudicate academic integrity cases.

Work that you submit is assumed to be original unless your source material is documented appropriately, using proper citation. **This includes using AI assistance in writing, coding and solving problems**. At a minimum, any student caught violating Academic Integrity Policy will receive no credit for the work concerned and one grade lower letter grade.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that this course outline may change without prior notice. There may be instances where adjustments are needed for the course content, schedule, or grading policy. As a result, it is important that students check the official course syllabus on canvas regularly for the latest updates. -->
