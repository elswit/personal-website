__Scientific machine learning__ (SciML) combines traditional scientific computing with modern machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in science and engineering. Its goal is to improve how we model, simulate, and predict natural and physical systems by integrating data-driven approaches with the traditional mathematical models used in scientific disciplines.

### Key Aspects of Scientific Machine Learning:

1. **Combining Models with Data**:
   - Traditionally, scientists have used mathematical models (i.e., equations) to describe how complex systems work. These models are based on physical laws or theoretical principles.
   - Machine learning, on the other hand, uses data to find patterns and make predictions without relying on predefined relationships. *SciML* integrates these two approaches, using machine learning to improve or complement existing scientific models.

2. **Addressing Uncertainty**:
   - In scientific problems, uncertainty estimation is a significant challenge. We often donâ€™t know all the inner workings of complex systems or if the data we gathered is flawed. SciML provides mechanisms to manage this uncertainty better, helping to make more reliable predictions and simulations even when the data is noisy.

3. **Learning New Patterns**:
   - In some cases, scientists might not have an existing model for a problem. SciML can help discover new patterns in the data and suggest possible underlying principles, which can lead to new scientific insights.

### Some Real-World Examples of SciML:

- **Physics**: In fluid dynamics, which studies how gases and liquids flow, SciML is used to improve predictions about how air moves around objects like airplane wings, helping engineers design better planes.
- **Climate Science**: Machine learning is used alongside physical modeling to make climate predictions faster and more accurate, helping to forecast extreme weather events more efficiently.
- **Biology**: SciML helps researchers predict how diseases spread by learning from both biological models and real-world observations, improving the design of interventions or treatments.
